## Start here

I am writing this for new code (Insert or shortcut Ctrl + Alt + i)

```{r}
################################################
### Code 1: Read in data
################################################

################################################
### The code in this file covers the following:
################################################

  # Read in external data (Excel files, CSVs) with readr and readxl
  # Initial data exploration
  # Set up GitHub
  
# Libraries needed

library(here) # easier file referencing 
library(tidyverse) # reading in CSV files and more
library(readxl) # reading in Excel files


## Read in external data (Excel files, CSVs) with readr and readxl

# Our first data set is a comma-separated-value (CSV) file containing visitation 
# data for all National Parks in California (ca_np.csv)

ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca_np.csv"))

# Our second data set is a single Excel worksheet containing only visitation for 
# Channel Islands National Park (ci_np.xlsx)

ci_np <- readxl::read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))

## Initial data exploration

# Can look at the data in the environment tab, 
# or with functions such as follows:

names(ca_np) # check what all the variable names are
head(ca_np) # first 6 rows of the data
summary(ca_np) # quick summary of each variable
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
